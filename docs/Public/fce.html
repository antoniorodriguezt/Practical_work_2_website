                    <h4> Computer Engineering in Society </h4>
                    <p> During this phase, we can observe different facets of the evolution of technologies and computers, specifying their timeline and key characteristics, as well as the development of some components by hardware, such as the microprocessor, or factors like fiber optics and their related technologies. On the other hand, we can also find the current situation of modern technologies, their characteristics, and benefits. This section also references the potential career opportunities offered by computer engineering, the supply and demand for work, and identifies and distinguishes some of the most popular professions. It also emphasizes the personal curriculum and the key aspects of an excellent employee. </p>

                    <h4> Current paradigms and trends in systems and applications </h4>
                    <p> Some of the topics related to the main trends in systems and applications can include hardware, which consists of the physical face of current technology, covering elements such as types of personal computers, components, or the history of hardware development. Regarding software, we can define it as a set of instructions called programs that are used to operate computers that perform specific tasks. In this sector, the stages of program development are specified, the methods and tools for developing it, and how the computer transforms the code to the CPU. On the other hand, the role of operating systems is illustrated, which represent the system software responsible for managing the hardware and software resources of the computer, as well as providing essential services to the computer programs. This area emphasizes its main functions and operations. Finally, we can highlight analog networks, telecommunications, and the history of their development. </p>
